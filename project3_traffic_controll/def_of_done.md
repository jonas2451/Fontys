Definition of Done:

- Implementing : The user story with some comments on what it does, if needed (with user interface; if needed) and commit it to github

- Testing : Put in correct data -> should work / put in incorrect data -> should not break the program, but give information about where the user input was wrong

- Review it by a different person -> ensuring consistency through comparison, look over the code in general if it makes sense, run the tests, try to break it, check if the guidelines are obeyed
